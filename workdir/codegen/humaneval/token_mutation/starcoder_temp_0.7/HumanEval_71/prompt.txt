def triangle_area(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> float:
    """
    Given the n of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise sum -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the area of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    >>> triangle_area(3, 4, 5)
    6.0
    >>> triangle_area(1, 2, 10)
    -1
