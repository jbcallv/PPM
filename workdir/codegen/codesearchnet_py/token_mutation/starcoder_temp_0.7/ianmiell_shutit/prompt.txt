def parse_args(self):
		r"""Responsible for parsing arguments from the command line.

		Environment variables:
		SHUTIT_OPTIONS:
		Loads command line options from the stack (if set).
		Behaves like GREP_OPTIONS:
			- space separated list of arguments
			- arguments before a space escapes the space separation
			- backslash before a backslash is interpreted as a single backslash
			- all other options are treated literally
		eg ' a\ b c\\ \\d \\\e\' becomes '', 'a b', 'c\', '\d', '\\e\'
		SHUTIT_OPTIONS is ignored if we are creating a skeleton
