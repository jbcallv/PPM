        Send *datum* to ACE and return the response with context.

        The *keys* parameter can be used to track item identifiers
        through an ACE interaction. If the `task` member is set on
        the ace instance (or one of its subclasses), it is
        kept in the environment as well.

            datum (str): the input sentence or MRS
            keys (dict): a mapping of item - names and values
