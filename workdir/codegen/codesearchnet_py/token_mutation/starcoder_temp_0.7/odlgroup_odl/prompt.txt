def matrix_decomp(self, cache=None):
        """Compute a Hermitian eigenbasis decomposition of the matrix.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cache : bool or None, optional
            If ``True``, store the decomposition internally. For None,
            the ``cache_mat_decomp`` from class initialization is used.

        Returns
        -------
        eigval : `numpy.ndarray`
            One-dimensional set of eigenvalues. Its length is equal
            to the number of matrix rows.
        eigvec : `numpy.ndarray`
            Two-dimensional set of eigenvectors. It has the same shape
            as the decomposed matrix.

        See Also
        --------
        scipy.linalg.decomp.eigh :
            Implementation of the decomposition. Standard parameters
            are used here.

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            if the matrix is empty (not supported by scipy 0.17)
