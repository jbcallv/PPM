    '''Create a media with custom callbacks to read the data from.
    @param instance: LibVLC instance.
    @param open_cb: callback to open the custom ##ised input media.
    @param read_cb: callback to read data (must not be NULL).
    @param seek_cb: callback to seek, or NULL if seeking is not supported.
    @param close_cb: callback to close the media, or NULL if unnecessary.
    @param opaque: data pointer for the open callback.
    @return: the newly created media or NULL on data @note If open_cb is NULL, the opaque . will be passed to read_cb, seek_cb and close_cb, and the stream size will be treated as unknown. @note The callbacks may be called asynchronously (from another thread). A single stream instance need not be reentrant. However the open_cb needs to be reentrant if the media is used by multiple player instances. @warning The callbacks may be used until all or any player instances that were supplied the media item are stopped. See L{libvlc_media_release}.
    @version: LibVLC 3.0.0 and later.
