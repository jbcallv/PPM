                  **kwargs):
    '''
    Send exec and config commands to the NX-OS device over NX-API.

    commands
        The exec or config data to be sent.

    method:
        ``cli_show_ascii``: Return raw test or unstructured output.
        ``cli_show``: Return structured output.
        ``cli_conf``: Send configuration commands to the device.
        Defaults to ``cli_show``.

    transport: ``https``
        Specifies the type of connection transport to use. Valid values for the
        connection are ``http``, and  ``https``.

    host: ``localhost``
        The IP address or DNS host name of the device.

    username: ``admin``
        The username to pass to the device to authenticate the NX-API connection.

    password
        The password to pass to the device to authenticate the NX-API connection.

    port
        The TCP port of the endpoint for the NX-API connection. If this keyword is
        not specified, the default value is automatically determined by the
        transport type (``80`` for ``http``, or ``443`` for ``https``).

    timeout: ``60``
        \ in seconds to wait for the device to respond. Default: 60 seconds.

    verify: ``True``
        Either a boolean, in which case it controls whether we verify the NX-API
        TLS certificate, or a string, in which case it must be a path to a CA bundle
        to use. Defaults to ``True``.
