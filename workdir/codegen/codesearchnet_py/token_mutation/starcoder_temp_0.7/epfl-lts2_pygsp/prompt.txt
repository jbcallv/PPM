                         compute_full_eigen=False, root=None):
    r"""Compute a multiresolution of trees

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : Graph
        Graph structure of a tree.
    Nlevel : Number of times to downsample and coarsen the tree
    root : int
        The index of the root of the tree. (default = 1)
    reduction_method : str
        The graph reduction method (default = 'resistance_distance')
    compute_full_eigen : bool
        To also compute the graph Laplacian vertices for every tree in the sequence

    Returns
    -------
    Gs : ndarray
        Ndarray, with each element containing a ##s structure represent a reduced tree.
    subsampled_vertex_indices : ndarray
        Indices of the graph of the previous tree that are kept for the subsequent tree.
