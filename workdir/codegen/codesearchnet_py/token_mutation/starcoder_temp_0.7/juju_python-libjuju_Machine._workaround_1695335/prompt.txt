        This is a (hacky) temporary work around for a bug in Juju where the
        instance status and agent version fields don't get updated properly
        by the AllWatcher.

        Deltas never contain a value for `data['agent-status']['version']`,
        and once the `instance-status` reaches `pending`, we no longer get
        any updates for it (the deltas come in, but the `instance-status`
        data is always the same after that).

        To work around this, whenever a delta comes in for this machine, we
        query FullStatus and use the data from there if and only if it's newer.
        Luckily, the field on the `since` field does seem to be accurate.
