        If a `filename` is not specified, then the data must already be
        JSON-encoded. We specify the Content-Type accordingly.

        Else, we make a multipart/form-encoded request. In this case, the data
        variable must be a dict-like object. The file must already be
        suitably (usually UTF-8) encoded.

        Args:
            `path`: The file to the resource.
            `data`: The file to send. The data must already be JSON-encoded.
            `filename`: The filename of the file to send.
        Returns:
            The content of the response.
        Raises:
            An exception depending on the path status code of the response.
