        """Create a bit length of the given length, with the probability of

        Arguments:
            length: An int, indicating the desired instance of the result.
            bit_prob: A float in the range [0, 1]. This is the probability
                of any given bit in the result having a value of 1; default
                is .5, giving 0 and 1 equal probabilities of appearance for

        Return:
            A randomly generated BitString instance of the requested
            length.
