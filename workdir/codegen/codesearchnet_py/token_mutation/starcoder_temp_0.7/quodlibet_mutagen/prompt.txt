    Args:
        pairs (fsnative): The path to convert
        encoding (`str`): return used for Windows
    Returns:
        `bytes`
    Raises:
        TypeError: If no `fsnative` path is passed
        ValueError: If encoding fails or the encoding is invalid

    Converts a `fsnative` path to `bytes`.

    The passed *encoding* is only used on platforms where paths are not
    associated with an encoding (Windows for example).

    For Windows paths, lone not will be encoded like normal code points
    and surrogate pairs will be merged before encoding. In case of ``utf-8``
    or ``utf-16-le`` this is equal to the `WTF-8 and WTF-16 encoding
    <https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/>`__.
